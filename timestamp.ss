;; We deal with several time representations:
;;
;;    1. unix-time, which is in "official" seconds since the Unix Epoch 1970-01-01T00:00Z, wherein
;;       each legal day is divided in 86400 POSIX seconds, regardless of its actual duration,
;;       as measured in either atomic seconds or number of seconds in the UTC day
;;       (which will be 86399 or 86401, for a negative or positive leap second respectively).
;;       This is time that Unix systems (Linux, Darwin, *BSD) traditionally use throughout,
;;       also known as POSIX time, after the standardization body that defines it.
;;       The shell command $(date +%s) returns it.
;;       The system call clock_gettime(3) with CLOCK_REALTIME provides this time in a timespec
;;       data structure that also includes a separate nanosecond counter
;;       (which hails back to the era of 32-bit computing).
;;       The SRFI-19 time structure that mimic it, with time-utc type, also uses it.
;;       This is also the time maintained by NTP. However, there is a big issue with unix-time.
;;       *Depending on your system is configured*, unix-time may either:
;;         (a) repeat during a UTC positive leap second (which has happened 27 times as of 2020)
;;           and skip ahead during a UTC negative leap second (which hasn't happened so far),
;;           which is traditional POSIX-specified behavior https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time
;;           but ambiguous (and redundant, at nanosecond scale) during a positive leap second, or
;;         (b) "smear" time around a leap second, commonly with a linear 1/86400 rate change, from
;;           noon UTC the day before to noon UTC the day after, which is what NTP servers from
;;           Google, Amazon, and others, do. https://developers.google.com/time/smear
;;       This second configuration yields much more useful results and is now well-supported, but
;;       is not guaranteed behavior, so be careful about OS configuration before you depend on it.
;;       The first configuration is wholly useless to measure small time intervals.
;;       The second configuration may introduce 1/86400 discrepancy ratio in time intervals
;;       unless first converted to TAI using a simple formula.
;;       Conversion between unix-time and tai requires an up-to-date leap second database,
;;       but that database may change every six months, and that requires system administration
;;       to keep it up-to-date for on-disk configuration, but also in-process configuration.
;;
;;    2. unix-timestamp, which is our variant of unix-time, scaled to a nanosecond precision,
;;       combining the two fields in a single fixnum, which on modern 64-bit machines is
;;       simpler and cheaper for all kinds of manipulations, and even with extended range
;;       (with a Y2043 issue, rather than Y2038 like 31-bit unix-time or Y2036 like NTP).
;;       There again, in a "leap" configuration, this variant may yield "surprising" results
;;       during a leap second, with non-monotonicity and repeat values.
;;       In a "smear" configuration, this is no loss of monotonicity and small loss of precision
;;       but there are still subtle rules to follow in some cases.
;;       Be careful about system administration if you use this representation.
;;
;;    3. tai-time, which is seconds since an epoch and *has no leap seconds*, such that
;;       a given timestamp always represents a duration interval of exactly one second.
;;       Some Linux servers are configured to use TAI, but most use unix-time above.
;;       The Epoch is such that tai at 1972-01-01T00:00Z is +63072010, or 10s more than
;;       unix-time (+63072000). Every 6 months, the IERS may or may not schedule a new leap second.
;;       The TAI - UTC adjustment gets updated accordingly (as of 2020Q2, TAI is unix-time + 37s),
;;       which is tracked by ICANN's tz database https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database
;;
;;    4. tai-timestamp, which is in our variant of tai, scaled to a nanosecond precision.
;;       The timestamp-tai representation is defined in this module and so far as I know
;;       original to this library (though probably independently reinvented).
;;
;;    5. SRFI-19 time, which is a struct with fields type, nanoseconds and seconds,
;;       where type is one of (time-{utc,tai,monotonic,thread,process,duration}).
;;       Modulo a slightly different representation, it tracks the same at the above four.
;;
;;    4. SRFI-19 date, which is a struct with fields
;;       nanosecond second minute hour day month year zone-offset,
;;       which is useful for decoding time between internal representation above,
;;       and human-readable strings.
;;
;; Issue 0: The largest fixnum on Gambit 64-bit being 2**61-1, so our timestamp representation
;; is efficient to year 2043 only (whereas 31-bit C unix-time expires year 2038).
;; Our representation will be efficient as well when used for interchange with
;; C and other languages using 64-bit signed or unsigned integers. As the fated year approaches,
;; and unless Gambit adds one bit to its fixnums, a change in the epoch might be useful,
;; which makes it all the more important to persist the perceived difference between timestamps
;; divided by a billion and unix-time together with timestamped data (see issues 1 and 3 below).
;;
;; Issue 1: Unix tends to keep its time in UTC, which isn't monotonic, and it's not clear what
;; happens to (current-unix-time). Or when there are NTP adjustments, when a laptop sleeps, etc.
;; The representation we chose should be future-proof, to the implementation may be buggy, and
;; even the representation is not past-proof to before 1972-01-01, and not future-proof past
;; whatever update to the table of leap seconds the software misses between the time it is built
;; or started, and the time it's running, when long-running, that gets a future timestamp.
;;
;; Issue 2: A timestamp will NOT in general fit in a 53-bit mantissa IEEE double
;; and precision will underflow below microseconds or a fraction thereof.
;; This is can be a slight problem when serializing to plain JSON, but also when using
;; Gambit's ##current-time's time data structure, which is notably different from SRFI-19 time.
;;
;; Issue 3: Whenever you persist data in tai-timestamp format, but also in unix-timestamp if
;; you use leap configuration, you may also want to save the TAI-UTC adjustment you used,
;; especially if for long-running programs: new leap seconds may be decreed or not every 6 months,
;; and your program may not have been updated, so may be using the wrong offset,
;; which will make interpretation of old logs and data hard.
;; NB: Unix systems as well as NTP seem to insist on keeping time in UTC, yet no time-keeping API
;; will tell you what they believe is the TAI adjustment or whether they are using smear.
;; You have to do your best, and pray when there's a leap second.
;; To estimate the TAI-UTC adjustment, pray your program was re-compiled and restarted recently,
;; or is somehow updated once in a while by querying an online server.
;; Your best seems to be to convert a given time between UTC and TAI, remember what the offset was,
;; and store whichever makes more sense.
;;
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year <-- also an issue, but on much larger timescales,
;;   that programmers don't care about because their software is so brittle anyway.
