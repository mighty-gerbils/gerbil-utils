;;;; Watching and restarting OS-spawned subprocesses

;; TODO:
;; V1:
;; Store the PID in a watch file
;; Don't worry too much about atomicity, there will be a human operator watching
;;
;; V2:
;; Have a poor man's ORB store the communication end-points and PIDs in a SQLite DB.
;; Use two-phase commit so the new process only actually starts after its PID is registered.
;; When gracefully killing an old process, minimize the time during which neither is active.
;;
;; V3:
;; Go get Erlang documentation, do the same things that they do.
;; Make sure that spawning and registering actors in the "process tree" is atomic.
;; Have an ORB for services to find each other? Use the actual Erlang protocol? dbus or similar?
;;
;; V4:
;; Have a migration protocol so the old process can migrate state (snapshot + increments)
;; to the new one before the new one becomes master and it dies, ensuring no connection is lost.
