;;;; Effectful generators as fonts of data elements
;;;
;;; Generators are data fonts, producing an effectful stream of data elements,
;;; to be somehow connected to a data sink that will consume the elements.
;;; They can be viewed in several complementary ways:
;;; Iterators (as per std/iter) are mutable objects that allow their user to advance in the stream
;;; one element at a time, querying the stream in a pull interface.
;;; Iterating functions, like for-each!, take a function as argument, and sequentially call it
;;; with each element in the stream, in a push interface.
;;; Generating functions, are a pull interface like iterators, packaged in a single procedure,
;;; like python "iterators", that returns the next element every time it's called, until it
;;; reaches the end and raises an #!eof instead.
;;;
;;; The "push" and "pull" family of interfaces are dual views related to each other
;;; by *inversion of control* (i.e. use of call/cc).
;;; Gerbil uses first class continuations and/or actors to implement inversion of control
;;; within the language, in a way more powerful than e.g. the limited system-provided pattern
;;; available within Python to define iterators by specifyingn a generator.
;;; For instance, our "yield" is a regular function can be called in a subroutine
;;; or passed to a higher-order function.
;;;
;;; A generator will generate its values only once.
;;; Using one of the interfaces commits the user to keep using that interface,
;;; and it is not specified what happens if the user uses one then the other.
;;; Specific generators can specify what happens.
;;;
;;; TODO: Also have a concurrent variant, that sends asynchronous messages in parallel,
;;; rather than call synchronous functions in sequence.
;;; Also have a pure functional interface in terms of functors and map.
;;; Extract all the variants from a single specification using a description in linear logic,
;;; in the style of my 2012 article about my Lisp-Interface-Library.
;;;
;;; Still unsatisfactorily using dynamic raise and side-effects rather than a pure interface.
;;; TODO: a monadic alternative? one with pure call/cc but no other side-effects
;;; and static continuations?
;;;
;;; Riastradh proposes to use delimited continuations as in:
;;; (define ((generator f)) (shift f))
;;; (define-syntax for (syntax-rules () ((for x g b0 b1+ ...) (reset (let ((x (g))) b0 b1+ ...)))))
;;; (for x (generator (lambda (yield) (yield 0) (yield 1) (yield 2))) (pp x))
;;; https://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/shift-reset.scm
;;; https://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/fshift-freset.scm
;;;
;;; TODO: deprecate in favor of SRFI 158 generators?
;;; https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html ?
;;; Or make a counter-proposal?
;;; They use an in-band fixed eof object instead of out-of-band exception,
;;; probably because there is no standard exception mechanism in Scheme.
;;; Should eof be a parameter? With a special form to rebind it to a fresh local object?
;;;
;;; TODO: Do generators as actor? A lighter-weight actor syntax would be nice, too.
