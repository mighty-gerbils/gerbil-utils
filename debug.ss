;; DBG macro for easier print-debugging
;; as ported from Common Lisp's ASDF (in asdf/uiop/contrib/debug.lisp).
;;
;; Usage: (DBG tag forms ...)
;;
;; tag is typically a constant string or keyword to identify who is printing,
;; but can be an arbitrary expression returning a tag to be display'ed first;
;; if the expression returns #f, nothing is printed.
;;
;; forms are expressions, which when the tag was not #f are evaluated in order,
;; with their source code then their return values being write'n each time.
;; The last expression is *always* evaluated and its multiple values are returned,
;; but its source and return values are only printed if tag was not #f;
;; previous expressions are not evaluated at all if tag was #f.
;; The macro expansion has relatively low overhead in space or time.
;;
